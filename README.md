# SideEffectsMayInclude
#### A tool for predicting drug side effects from molecular structure

SideEffectsMayInclude is package to train and deploy a deep neural network model in PyTorch to predict drug side effects from their molecular structure. The model employs Graph Convolutional Network layers and a Bidirectional LSTM to separately extract signal from the molecular structure in graph form and in a SMILES string, respectively.

### Installation

To use this tool, you must first clone or download the GitHub repo on your local machine or AWS EC2 instance.

Then, build the Docker image:

`Docker`
